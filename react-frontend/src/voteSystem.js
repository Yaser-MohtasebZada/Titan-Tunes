I have to finish this sprint on jira
and here is my part

also can you add you to our github or something which is allowed by the professor so you make out job easier

5:01 PM
Looking at your Jira board and the proposal, I can see you're working on the Song Submission Frontend (DS3-45) with subtasks like connecting to backend, success/error notifications, duplicate handling, and optimistic UI — and it's currently 20% done (only the song submission component is marked DONE).

Let me help you think through what you need to finish. A couple of questions first:

Also, regarding adding me to GitHub — I'm not able to be added as a collaborator or commit code directly to repositories. I don't have a GitHub account or persistent identity between conversations. What I can do is write complete, ready-to-paste code for every subtask so the lift on your end is minimal!

I thought claude code was able to be added to repos

5:02 PM
You're right that Claude Code exists as a tool, but it works differently than you might be thinking:

Claude Code is a command-line tool you run locally on your own machine — it's not an account or bot that gets added to GitHub as a collaborator
It lets Claude read your codebase, write files, and run commands on your computer, but you still control what gets committed and pushed
Think of it more like a very powerful coding assistant running in your terminal, not a teammate with repo access
What you can do:

Install Claude Code locally (npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code)
Run it inside your cloned repo
It can read all your files, write code, and you review/commit the changes
In the meantime, right here in this chat I can:

Write complete React components for all your DS3-45 subtasks
Give you code you can copy-paste directly into your repo
Help you work through the Firebase + Spotify integration logic
So — want me to go ahead and start generating the code for your remaining subtasks (DS3-47 through DS3-50)? Just let me know what your current file/component structure looks like and I'll write it to fit right in.

okay help me 
here is out github:
let me know which code files you want to see I will also paste the last commit the my teamate nickel nickel has done :

5:03 PM
⚠️ Quick security heads-up first!

Your spotify.js in that commit has your Client Secret and Refresh Token hardcoded and publicly visible on GitHub:

js
const CLIENT_SECRET = "REMOVED_SEE_ENV_EXAMPLE";
const REFRESH_TOKEN = "REMOVED_SEE_ENV_EXAMPLE...";
You should immediately:

Go to developer.spotify.com → your app → regenerate your Client Secret
Revoke that refresh token
Move these to a .env file and add .env to .gitignore
Now for your sprint — to help you write the right code, please share these files:

App.jsx (full file)
firebase.js
voteSystem.js
Login.jsx
NowPlaying.jsx
Your subtasks are:

DS3-47 — Connect submission to backend (Firestore)
DS3-48 — Success/error notifications
DS3-49 — Duplicate submission handling
DS3-50 — Optimistic UI
Once I see those files I can write you a complete updated SongSearch.jsx that handles all four subtasks in one go.

5:05 PM
Got everything I need. Let me also flag a few things I noticed before writing the code:

Also exposed in firebase.js: Your Firebase API key is public. This one is less critical (Firebase keys are meant to be public) BUT you need to set up Firestore Security Rules to protect your data.

voteSystem.js has a syntax error — explort instead of export on line with trackUserVoting, and the function is also placed inside getVoteData which will break things. I'll fix that too.

Now let me write all your subtasks. Here's the updated SongSearch.jsx handling DS3-47, 48, 49, and 50:


Check frontend design skill

Now I have everything. Let me write the complete updated files:


Updated SongSearch.jsx with all 4 subtasks: Firestore backend, notifications, duplicate detection, optimistic UI
Updated SongSearch.jsx with all 4 subtasks: Firestore backend, notifications, duplicate detection, optimistic UI
Now the fixed voteSystem.js:


Fixed voteSystem.js - fixes syntax errors and broken function nesting

Also update App.jsx to pass user down to SongSearch:


Created a file, read a file
Created a file, read a file
Here's a summary of what each file covers for your Jira tickets:

SongSearch.jsx — covers all 4 subtasks:

DS3-47 — submitSongToFirestore() writes the song to a submittedSongs Firestore collection with title, artist, URI, who submitted it, and a status: "pending" field for admin moderation later
DS3-48 — Toast component shows color-coded success/error/warning popups that auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
DS3-49 — isDuplicate() queries Firestore by spotifyId before submitting, blocks if it already exists
DS3-50 — button immediately flips to "✓ Submitted" and turns green the moment you click, before Firestore even responds
voteSystem.js — fixed the syntax errors (explort typo, exsitingVoter typo, and trackUserVoting being accidentally nested inside getVoteData)

App.jsx — just passes user as a prop to SongSearch so the submission can store submittedBy: user.uid in Firestore

One thing to do before committing: move your Spotify CLIENT_SECRET and REFRESH_TOKEN into a .env file (name the variables VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET etc.) and make sure .env is in your .gitignore.

now guide me step by step lie I have no experience with coding and github
to put everything together and add the into jira and fix everything

5:07 PM
Let's go step by step. First, what's your current situation?

Q: Do you have the project on your computer already?
A: I have multiple tabs open including github

Q: What computer are you on?
A: jira

5:10 PM
Jira is your project management tool, not a computer 😄 — I need to know what device you're physically typing on right now!

Also "multiple tabs open including github" doesn't tell me if the code is downloaded to your computer yet.

Q: What kind of computer are you on right now?
A: I mena I have my windows and I have the github repo open and I can make changes

Q: Is the code downloaded to your computer?
A: No, I only see it on the GitHub website

5:10 PM
Got it! So you're on Windows and you only have GitHub open in your browser. We need to set everything up from scratch. Let's do this in order:

STEP 1 — Install Git
Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
Click the download button, run the installer
Click Next on every screen — the defaults are fine
When done, press the Windows key, search for "Git Bash", open it
You should see a black terminal window. Type this and hit Enter:

git --version
It should say something like git version 2.x.x

STEP 2 — Install Node.js
Go to https://nodejs.org
Download the LTS version (the left green button)
Run the installer, click Next on everything
When done, in Git Bash type:
node --version
Should say v20.x.x or similar

STEP 3 — Install VS Code (your code editor)
Go to https://code.visualstudio.com
Download and install it
Tell me when you've done these 3 installs and I'll walk you through downloading the repo, replacing the files, fixing the Spotify secret, and pushing it all back to GitHub.

Don't skip ahead — each step builds on the last! 🙂

git version 2.53.0.windows.1
v24.14.0
I already have vs code

5:14 PM
Perfect, you're all set! Now let's get the code onto your computer.

STEP 4 — Clone the Repo
Go to your GitHub repo in the browser
Click the green "< > Code" button
Make sure HTTPS is selected, then click the copy icon next to the URL
Then in Git Bash type this (replace the URL with what you copied):

git clone https://github.com/kristinvalido/Data-Science-3.git
Hit Enter. You'll see it downloading.

Then type:

cd Data-Science-3/react-frontend
Then:

code .
This opens the project in VS Code. Tell me when VS Code opens with the project files visible on the left side panel.

1773793004816_image.png
this is what I see on vs code:

5:16 PM
VS Code is open with the project. Click "Yes" on that popup in the bottom right first.

Now I can see your file structure. Let's replace the files.

STEP 5 — Create the .env file (fix the exposed secrets)
In VS Code, click Terminal in the top menu bar → New Terminal

A terminal opens at the bottom. Type:

cd src
Then:

New-Item .env
Now in the left panel you'll see .env appear in the src folder. Click it and paste this:

VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=47eb2e8b7c944819911b84566e9fc579
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_new_secret_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_new_refresh_token_here
Leave it open — we'll fill in the real values after you regenerate them on Spotify's website.

STEP 6 — Replace the 3 files
In the left panel, click on src to expand it, then click on SongSearch.jsx.

The file opens on the right. Select all the text (Ctrl+A) and delete it, then paste in the entire contents of the SongSearch.jsx I gave you earlier.

Do the same for voteSystem.js and App.jsx.

Tell me when all 3 are replaced and I'll walk you through the Spotify secret regeneration and then pushing to GitHub.

No worries! You pasted that into the terminal instead of the file. The terminal tries to run code, not save it.

Let's do it the right way:

Create the .env file correctly
In the terminal, type exactly this and hit Enter:

New-Item .env
Then stop using the terminal for this part. Instead:

Look at the left panel in VS Code
You should now see a file called .env inside the src folder
Click on it to open it
Paste this into the file:
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=47eb2e8b7c944819911b84566e9fc579
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_new_secret_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_new_refresh_token_here
Press Ctrl+S to save
Tell me when you see the .env file open with that text in it, and we'll move to regenerating your Spotify credentials to fill in the real values.

I pasted the stuff into env ifile

5:18 PM
Perfect! Now let's regenerate your Spotify credentials so those your_new_secret_here placeholders get real values.

STEP 7 — Regenerate Spotify Credentials
Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
Log in with whatever Spotify account your team used
Click on your Titan Tunes app
Click Settings
You'll see Client Secret — click "View client secret"
Click "Rotate Secret" (this kills the old exposed one and makes a new one)
Copy the new secret
Now go back to your .env file in VS Code and replace your_new_secret_here with the new secret.

For the refresh token, that's a bit more involved.

Do you have access to the Spotify account your team used, or was that Nicholas's account?

This matters because if it's not your account you'll need to ask him to rotate it, or your team needs to decide whose Spotify account controls playback going forward.

lets forget this part and move on to my tasks

5:19 PM
Sure! Let's move on.

STEP 8 — Replace your 3 files
In VS Code, look at the left panel and click src to expand it. You'll see all your files.

File 1: Click on SongSearch.jsx → Select all (Ctrl+A) → Delete → Paste the new SongSearch.jsx code I gave you → Ctrl+S

File 2: Click on voteSystem.js → Select all (Ctrl+A) → Delete → Paste the new voteSystem.js code → Ctrl+S

File 3: Click on App.jsx → Select all (Ctrl+A) → Delete → Paste the new App.jsx code → Ctrl+S

The code is in the files I gave you earlier in this conversation — scroll up and you'll see the 3 download links. Open each one, copy everything, and paste into the matching file in VS Code.

Tell me when all 3 are saved and I'll walk you through testing it runs, then pushing to GitHub!
